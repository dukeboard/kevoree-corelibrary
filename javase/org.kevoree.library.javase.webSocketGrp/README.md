# WebSocketGroup documentation

This Kevoree Group provides a WebSocket implementation of fragment communications

## What could I use it for?
In this module you have 4 different kinds of group.  
Each one has its own purpose and works with WebSocket API such as [Webbit] [1] & [Java_WebSocket] [2]

## The 4 different groups
* **WebSocketGroup**: starts a server on each fragment meaning that if a node is behind a router you probably won't be able to push/pull anything from it. Plus, for each request (pull, push) a dedicated client will be created.

* **WebSocketGroupMasterServer**: requires that you specify **one** (and only one) master server within your group nodes making this group a fully centralized network. Other nodes will connect themselves to this master server. This group disallows push/pull requests on all nodes but the **master server**; throwing exceptions back at you if you dare to try anyway :D
								  
* **WebSocketGroupEchoer**: same as **WebSocketGroupMasterServer** but this one allows you to push/pull on each node

* **WebSocketGroupQueuer**: same as **WebSocketGroupEchoer** but this one puts not-yet-connected nodes into a **waitingQueue**, and dispatches pushed models (in the order they have been pushed) to clients when they initiate a connection to the master server

## What about the first one : *WebSocketGroup*
### Node start
When a node starts, this group creates a Webbit socket server listening on the given "port" property set in the fragment-dependant dictionary attribute. With this group, server are able to handle 2 kinds of request:

*   PUSH
*   PULL

In order to recognize those requests, WebSocketGroup uses a really simple control-byte protocol:

```java
protected static final byte PUSH = 1;
protected static final byte PULL = 0;
protected static final byte PULL_JSON = 42;
```

### Push process
When a push is requested on a node. This group compresses the given model and try to send it to the targeted node on :

*   ws://host:port/

The targeted node will then process the model  
```java
case PUSH:
    logger.debug("Compressed model received from "+ connection.httpRequest().header("Host") + ": loading...");
    ByteArrayInputStream bais = new ByteArrayInputStream(msg, 1, msg.length-1);
    ContainerRoot model = KevoreeXmiHelper.instance$.loadCompressedStream(bais);
    updateLocalModel(model);
    logger.debug("Model loaded from XMI String");
    break;
```

### Pull process
When a pull is requested on a node. This group asks the targeted node via :

* ws://host:port/

The targeted node will then process the model  
```java
case PULL:
    logger.debug("Pull request received from "+ connection.httpRequest().header("Host") + ": loading...");
    ByteArrayOutputStream output = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
    KevoreeXmiHelper.instance$.saveCompressedStream(output, getModelService().getLastModel());
    connection.send(output.toByteArray());
    logger.debug("Compressed model pulled back to "+ connection.httpRequest().header("Host"));
    break;
```

## What about the second one : *WebSocketGroupMasterServer*
### Node start
With this group, when the group fragment starts on a node it will check if a **port** as been given to it.  
If a port as been given, then it means that the related node will be the **master server** and every other node will initiate a connection to it when they will start.

![WebSocketGroupMasterServer KevoreeEditor Config](http://i48.tinypic.com/2c0mte.jpg)

In this example, **node0** will be the master server because it has its port property set in the group (port 8000).

### Push process
WebSocketGroupMasterServer **only allows master server node** to process push requests. So if you try to do a push on an other node **nothing will happen**.  
By the way, if you initiate the push procedure on the master server node, it will send a request to the given node *host:port* via **WebSocket** following this schema:  

<table>
  <tr>
  	<td>URI</td>
    <td>ws://host:port/</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  	<td>data[0]</td>
    <td>control byte (to let the server know it is a PUSH)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  	<td>data[1..n]</td>
    <td>compressed model bytes</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Once the master server node receives the push request, it will deserialize the model and apply it locally.  
Then it will forward the push request to each sub-nodes of the group.

```java
/**
 * In this context you are a master server and you should do the work
 * associated with the PUSH event requested from another client.
 * 
 * @param connection
 *            a client
 * @param msg
 */
protected void onMasterServerPushEvent(WebSocketConnection connection, byte[] msg) {
	logger.debug("PUSH: " + connection.httpRequest().remoteAddress() + " asked for a PUSH");
	ByteArrayInputStream bais = new ByteArrayInputStream(msg, 1, msg.length - 1);
	ContainerRoot model = KevoreeXmiHelper.instance$.loadCompressedStream(bais);
	updateLocalModel(model);

	logger.debug("server knows: " + clients.toString());
	// broadcasting model to each client
	for (WebSocketConnection conn : clients.keySet()) {
		logger.debug("Trying to push model to client " + conn.httpRequest().remoteAddress());
		conn.send(msg, 1, msg.length - 1); // offset is for the control byte
	}
}
```

### Pull process
WebSocketGroupMasterServer **only allows master server node** to process pull requests. So if you try to do a pull on an other node a **NotAMasterServerException** will be thrown.
To process pull requests, this group will create a new WebSocketClient and send a message with the PULL control byte.  
Once the server receives the message it will serialize the model from the targetted node and send it back to the client.  

> This process uses *java.util.concurrent.Exchanger* in order to pass the model from the client thread to the pull method thread when it is done.  
> The Exchanger is created with a timeout set to 5 seconds, meaning that if the model is not sent back within this time you will get a **null** in return.


## What about the third one : *WebSocketGroupEchoer*
### Node start
Same as **WebSocketGroupMasterServer**

### Push process
Unlike **WebSocketGroupMasterServer** this group allows every node from the group to process PUSH requests.  
When a push request is initiated a new client is created and it sends a message to server following the same schema as seen before in WebSocketGroupMasterServer.
So this push is also broadcasted on each node.

### Pull process
Same as **WebSocketGroupMasterServer** but with the possibility to be made from every node in the group.

## What about the fourth one : *WebSocketGroupQueuer*
### Node start
On node start this group does the exact same work as **WebSocketEchoer** but it create a new Map<String, WebSocketConnection> that will keep tracks of not yet connected nodes.  

### Push process
When this group's master server receives a PUSH request, it will broadcast the model to each connected node **AND** if there is some nodes in this group that did not initiate a connection to the master server yet, it will keep a version of the current pushed model associated with this unconnected node to push the model back to him when it will connect.

```java
@Override
protected void onMasterServerPushEvent(WebSocketConnection connection, byte[] msg) {
	// deserialize the model from msg
	ByteArrayInputStream bais = new ByteArrayInputStream(msg, 1, msg.length - 1); // offset is for the control byte
	ContainerRoot model = KevoreeXmiHelper.instance$.loadCompressedStream(bais);
	updateLocalModel(model);
	
	// for each node in this group
	Group group = getModelElement();
	for (ContainerNode subNode : group.getSubNodes()) {
		String subNodeName = subNode.getName();
		if (!subNodeName.equals(getNodeName())) {
			// this node is not "me" check if we already have an active connection with him or not
			if (containsNode(subNodeName)) {
				// we already have an active connection with this client
				// so lets send the model back
				getSocketFromNode(subNodeName).send(msg, 1, msg.length - 1); // offset is for the control byte
				
			} else {
				// we do not have an active connection with this client
				// meaning that we have to store the model and wait for
				// him to connect in order to send the model back
				waitingQueue.put(subNodeName, model);
				logger.debug(subNodeName+" is not yet connected to master server. It has been added to waiting queue.");
			}
		}
	}
}
```

```java
@Override
protected void onMasterServerRegisterEvent(WebSocketConnection connection, String nodeName) {
	super.onMasterServerRegisterEvent(connection, nodeName);
	if (waitingQueue.containsKey(nodeName)) {
		// if we end up here, it means that this node wasn't connected
		// when a push request was initiated earlier and though it has
		// to get the new model back
		logger.debug(nodeName+" is in the waiting queue, meaning that we have to send the model back to him");
		ByteArrayOutputStream baos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
		KevoreeXmiHelper.instance$.saveStream(baos, waitingQueue.get(nodeName));
		connection.send(baos.toByteArray());
		waitingQueue.remove(nodeName);
	}
}
```

### Pull process
Same as **WebSocketEchoer**
